1. API Security  
  We can use middleware as a proxy to conceal our authentication server's URL.

### True or false: The route handler is middleware?  
I would say **false**. Though, they both behave similar. **Handler** functions are the ones that send responses, while **middleware** do not.  

### In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?  
In 2 ways:  
- Throwing an error `throw new Error(‘error message’)`  
- `next('error message')`  

### At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?  
The generated server allows for 3 extension points to inject middleware in its middleware chain. These are:
1. to add middleware all the way to the top of the middleware stack. 
2. right before actually handling a matched request.
3. setting the middleware for existing handler by its route and HTTP method. It can be done in the configureAPI function by calling api.AddMiddlewareFor method.  

### What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”  
The request handler function already sent a response to the client using the res.json() method which automatically sets the response header(every response to the client should contain headers) for the response(in this case theContent-Type to application/json). Node picks up this atrocity and our server crashes because express under the hood is attempting to set the response header for this second response.
