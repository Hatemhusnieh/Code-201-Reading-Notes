## Introduction  

**Functional Programming** is a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.  

Withing the concept of **functional programming** there are the **pure functions** and **immutability**, and they benefit the code we write in many ways.

## Pure functions

**Pure** **functions** is the first term to learn when trying to understand  functional programming. **Pure function**, are functions that return the same result if given the same arguments (they are also referred as **deterministic**), and they do not cause any observable side effects.  

There are several signs to an **impure function** like :  
- It uses global variables.  
    ```

    let PI = 3.14;

    const calculateArea = (radius) => radius * radius * PI;

    calculateArea(10);

    // PI is a global variable that might affect the results if changed    

    ```    

- It  reads external files.  
    ```
    const charactersCounter = (text) => `Character count: ${text.length}`;

    function analyzeFile(filename) {
    let fileContent = open(filename);
    return charactersCounter(fileContent);
    }

    ```
- It relies on a random number generator.  
    ```
    function yearEndEvaluation() {
    if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
        return "You get a raise!";
    } else {
        return "Better luck next year!";
    }
    }

    ```
- It  modifying a global object or a parameter passed by reference.  
    ```
    let counter = 1;

    function increaseCounter(value) {
    counter = value + 1;
    }

    increaseCounter(counter);

    ``` 

There are many benefits of **pure functions** like:

- The code is easier to test. 

- We don’t need to mock anything

- The code is consistent

## Immutability  

To say a code is **immutable**, to mean that it is unchanged or unable to change.  

When data is immutable, its **state cannot change after it’s created**. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a **new object with the new value**.  

mutable:
```

var values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var sumOfValues = 0;

for (var i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
  sumOfValues += values[i];
}

sumOfValues // 15

```

immutable:
```

let list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let accumulator = 0;

function sum(list, accumulator) {
  if (list.length == 0) {
    return accumulator;
  }

  return sum(list.slice(1), accumulator + list[0]);
}

sum(list, accumulator); // 15
list; // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
accumulator; // 0

```

## Referential transparency  

A function that consistently yields the same result for the same input, is **referentially transparent**.  

`pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency`  

---
## Node JS

A **module** is a part of a code that represent some functionality, and is made to be used in other code.  

So, instead of writing a big code in one file, we divide the code into pieces of modules. Each module will have a single or two things to do, which will make our code easier to be expanded and edit, and highly reusable.  


When we wanna use a module inside a file we use **require**, which will import the module, and enable us to use its functionality.  



To use a function inside a **module** for example the module is called **lolo.js** and its file is in the home directory and contains a function called `doCrazyThings` , in a file called **taboush.js** we write the following code:  

- First, inside **lolo.js** we have to specify what things we want to use outside, so we write in its global scope the following:  
`module.export doCrazyThings`  

- After that, inside **taboush.js**, assign the function of **lolo.js** in a variable with the use of `require`:  
`const doIT = require('doCrazyThings')`  

- Now we can use the function inside **taboush.js**.
