# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations
## Transforms
- The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.  

**Syntax**: 
```
div {
  -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
     -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
       -o-transform: scale(1.5);
          transform: scale(1.5);
}

```

### 2D Transforms
- you can rotate an element with `transform: rotate(## deg)` property.

- Also, you can rotate an element along any axis by `transform: rotateX(## deg)`(for X-axis) `transform: rotateY(## deg)` (for Y-axis)

- You can make an figure appear bigger or smaller by the `transform: scale(##);` property

- Also, you scale with respect to axis by `transform: scaleX(.5);`(for X-axis) or `transform: scale(.5, 1.15);` (X & Y axises)

- you can position an element  without interrupting its normal flow, just like `relative position` with `transform: translateX(-10px);` (X-axis) and `transform: translateY(25%);` for (Y-axis) or both.

- You distort an element along an axis with ` transform: skewX(5deg);` (for X-axis) `transform: skewY(-20deg);` (for Y-axis)

- You can combine between to properties of transform ; `transform: rotate(25deg) scale(.75);`

- The default transform origin is the dead center of an element, both 50% horizontally and 50% vertically. To change the origin use the `transform-origin` property. ;`transform-origin: 0 0;` or ` transform-origin: 100% 100%;` or `transform-origin: top left;`

- The perspective of an element can be set in two different ways. One way includes using the `perspective` value within the transform property on individual elements, while the other includes using the `perspective` property on the parent element residing over child elements being transformed.
    - ( individual perspectives with the perspective value) `transform: perspective(200px) rotateX(45deg);`
    - ( perspective property on their direct parent element.) `perspective: 200px;`

- You can also set a perspective-origin just like transform-origin with `perspective-origin: 0 0;`

### 3D Transforms
- You can change elements on the z axis.

- you can use both `scale` and `rotate` properties along the Z-axis

- Elements may also be translated on the Z-axis using the `translateZ` value. A negative value here will push an element further away on the z axis, resulting in a smaller element. Using a positive value will pull an element closer on the Z-axis, resulting in a larger element.

- Use `backface-visibility` and set its value to `hidden` to hide elements that are back faced.

## Transitions & Animations
With `CSS`3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

Animations within `CSS`3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

### Transition
- The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`, and `:target` pseudo-classes.

- There are four transition related properties in total, including `transition-property`, `transition-duration`, `transition-timing-function`, and `transition-delay`

- you can alter more than one property when doing transitions: `transition-property: background, border-radius;` 
```
.box:hover {
    background: #ff7b29;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }

```

- The duration in which a transition takes place is set using the `transition-duration`

- The `transition-timing-function` property is used to set the speed in which a transition will move.

- The `linear` keyword value identifies a transition moving in a constant speed from one state to another.

- The `ease-in` value identifies a transition that starts slowly and speeds up throughout the transition.

- The `ease-out` value identifies a transition that starts quickly and slows down throughout the transition.

- The `ease-in-out` value identifies a transition that starts slowly, speeds up in the middle, then slows down again before ending.

- You can also set a delay with the `transition-delay` property 

- You can shorthand transitions like this: `transition: background .2s linear, border-radius 1s ease-in 1s;`

### Animations
- To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the `@keyframes` rule. The `@keyframes` rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.
```
@keyframes slide {
  0% {
    left: 0;
    top: 0;
  }
  50% {
    left: 244px;
    top: 100px;
  }
  100% {
    left: 488px;
    top: 0;
  }
}

```


- Use `animation-name` after declaring keyframes for an animation with the animation name as the property value
```
.stage:hover .ball {
  animation-name: slide;
}

```

- You also can/need to identify `animation-duration`, `animation-timing-function` and `animation-delay` to make youe animation more linear.

- Animations also provide the ability to further customize an elementâ€™s behavior, including the ability to declare the number of times an animation runs, as well as the direction in which an animation completes.

- You can define how many times the animation will run by `animation-iteration-count` property

- You can also declare the direction an animation completes using the `animation-direction` property. Values for the `animation-direction` property include `normal`, `reverse`, `alternate`, and `alternate-reverse`.

- `animation-play-state` property allows an animation to be played or paused using the `running` and `paused` keyword values respectively. Like deciding if the animation will be running from the start of until clicking or hovering

- The `animation-fill-mode` property identifies how an element should be styled either before, after, or before and after an animation is run. The animation-fill-mode property accepts four keyword values, including `none`, `forwards`, `backwards`, and `both`
