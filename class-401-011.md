## Review, Research, and Discussion  
#### Importance of access control  
Access controls limit access to information and information processing systems. When implemented effectively, they mitigate the risk of information being accessed without the appropriate authorization, unlawfully and the risk of a data breach.  
#### Application that would need access control  
Ant organization that consist of important data need to apply access control, Banks, Universities, social media platforms, online shops and etc.  
#### Roles in Access Control  
Normally used in `RBAC` or **Role-Based Access Control**, it's assigned to users to give each one special access permissions like read, write, update and delete.  
#### Role-Based Access Control Scalability  
They reduce the tasks of an administrator or authorities when users take on different roles in an organization and need to be assigned different access rights or privileges based on these roles. RBAC is a very expressive and flexible access control mechanism that makes it possible to have security policies based on the principle of least privilege, static and dynamic separation of duties, conflicts between roles and permissions, and many more
