## Array.map()  

- The `map` method is an `Array` method, that produces an Array with same number of element of the original Array.  
- The `map` method takes a `function` and apply it to every element on the original array.  
- the `map` method takes 3 parameters:  
  1. a `callback function`
  1. index of the element on the original array
  1. the original array the `map` method was called upon   

```
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const newArray = originalArray.map(elm => elm +=1)
console.log(newArray);
// Output: newArray = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] 

```  

## Array.reduce()  

- The `reduce` method is an `Array` method, that produces an Array with same number  of element or less of the original Array.
- The `reduce` method normally used to produce a single output of an Array.
- The `reduce` method takes 4 parameters:  
  1. Accumulator
  1. Current Value
  1. Current Index
  1. Source Array
- The `Accumulator` can be givin an initial value ot it will be `undefined` by default.  

```
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const result = originalArray.reduce((acc, val) =>{
  return acc +=  val
},0);
console.log(result);
// Output: result = 15   

```  

## superagent()  

`SuperAgent` is light-weight progressive `ajax API` crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning curve after being frustrated with many of the existing request APIs. It also works with `Node.js`.  

### Superagent with .then()
```
const url = 'https://hatem/awesome?charm=999&intelligence=999'

superagent.get(url).then(result => console.log(result.body)).catch(err => console.error(err));

```  

### Superagent with async / await
```
const url = 'https://hatem/awesome?charm=999&intelligence=999'

const calling = async () =>{
  try {
    const response = await superagent.get(url);
    console.log(response.body)
  } catch(err) {
    console.error(err)
  }
}  

calling();

```  

## Promises  

In simple words, a `Promise` is a function that need some time to finish its work, and it promises to give results. We assign `callback functions` ton promises to resolve its **results** and **errors**  

A `Promise` is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.  

Superagent and Axios are examples of promises.  

Not all `callback functions` considered to be **Asynchronous**, because not all functions need time to be computed. Some functions can be computed immediately, so they are inline. Other `callback functions`, specially those that get and send data through the server need some time to send and get data and, thus they are **Asynchronous**, because the browser can not compute them immediately.
