## Review, Research, and Discussion
####  Singleton
A singleton or (singleton pattern) is a function or class which can have only one instance. It is a way of creating a single object that is shared with different part of the application or 3rd party users, without recreating it instance each time we want to use it

Only one instance of this object can instantiate at a time.  

### Singleton in Node  
1. We create a Singleton class in a js folder. We make a condition, that if there is no instance created, then we create it . After that we return the Singleton object.instance.  

```
class Singleton {
  constructor(){
    if(!Singleton.instance){
      Singleton.instance = this;
    }
    return Singleton.instance;
  }
}

```    
2. We instantiate our instance  

```
const ourInstance = new Singleton()  

```

3. We export only the instance.
```
module.exports = ourInstance;

```  
4. We import out instance to where we want to use it.  

#### Approaches to construct/operate a middleware system
I'll look for what services that my app will present and it's interface with other apps, to so it's middleware system can be vital to accept or refuse the interface of requests.The app middleware should have access to all app services and it is the one that put the rules of weather they are good to be processed ot not.

## Terms  
term | definition
--- | ---
Router Middleware | Router level middleware can be defined in the same way as application-level middleware
Dynamic Module Loading | The dynamic module loader library allows code to retrieve Node modules from a web server, install them locally and serve them up as though they’d been manually deployed to the running server.
Singleton Pattern | The Singleton Pattern limits the number of instances of a particular object to just one. This single instance is called the singleton.
CRUD -> REST Method Matches | When the class is reduced to one instance, and the constructor is remembered, the same instance returns
Mock Testing | Mock testing is an approach to unit testing that lets you make assertions about how the code under test is interacting with other system modules. In mock testing, the dependencies are replaced with objects that simulate the behavior of the real ones. … Such a service can be replaced with a mock object.
